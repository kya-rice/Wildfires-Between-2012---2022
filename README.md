https://geo.wa.gov/datasets/12712f465fc44fb58328c6e0255ca27e/explore
-WA county boundaries dataset

Bar that has a feature with buttons where you can select years between 2012-2022
-I have code on how to do this

Hover function where you can hover over map and get total acres burned for each county 
-Could use lab code

Potential option: on top of choropleth we could add another layer with the fire locations mapped where you can click on a fire location dot and get info about the specific fire
â€”- i.e. acres burned, start date, fire cause, county name
